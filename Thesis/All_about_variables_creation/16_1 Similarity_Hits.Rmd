1. *rmsP_median* - the more intense and energetic beat (Rock or Hard Electronic Instrumentals have higher values, classic trap, rnb, voice only audio messages or instrumentals without drums have lower values)
2. *rmsP_std* - the loudness of the harmonic content changes frequently (hyperpop or parts with changing drum patterns have higher values, pop/dance, voice only audio messages or instrumentals without drums (music with stable drum pattern) have lower values)
3. *contrast_median* - simple music (mostly positive) with one or two instruments has higher values of contrast_median, while songs with instrumental overload, complex multi-layered instrumental (in terms of the number of instruments, not in terms of the notes played) have lower values
4. *contrast_std* - the more variability in sound and therefore - more complexity. Songs where many instruments  change each other (very tonally dynamic, do not become a single layer, as in the case of a low contrast_median) have higher values, music with same sounds/instruments all along the whole song typically has lower values 
5. *tonnetz_median* - A higher median value suggests a more complex harmonic structure with more notes in the tonal system. Conversely, a lower median value suggests a simpler harmonic structure with fewer notes in the tonal system. So, songs with higher tonnetz_median would have more rich sound in terms of notes mixing, while songs with lower tonnetz_median would sound less interesting, but more catchy and simpler due to lack of tonal textures.
6. *tonnetz_std* - A higher standard deviation indicate that the song has more complex tonal relationships or a greater variety of musical elements. On the other hand, a lower standard deviation may suggest a simpler or more repetitive tonal structure.
7. *sound_brightness_noisiness* 
8. *laid_back_groovy_lyrical*
9. *quiet_and_melodic*
10. *overall_spectral_Variability*
