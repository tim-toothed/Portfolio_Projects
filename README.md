# My DS/DA Portfolio
## Timur Sharifullin

Welcome to my data scientist portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects, mostly in **R** (***do not pay attention to "HTML" in the languages ​​used - these are all reports from Rmd files***) and also **Python**. I prefer to use R for descriptives and statistical analysis, and Python for ML, data collection (Web-scraping, Parsing) and AI-related work (in this case it is not really a choice tbh...). 

You can fiind all of the important information about me in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11XiCNp62MQCrbYL68lCBQmrZm67Rt0IC/view?usp=sharing), so here I would jump straight into projects.
