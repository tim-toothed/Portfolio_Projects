Additional diorization module for OpenAI Whisper to transform audio-to-text taking into account the division of speech by speakers. Transform 1 hour of interview in 3 minutes. (Tuned for Russian language)

**Background**
As a sociology student I always hate interview transcribing when you have to transform audio to text with all the formatting by hand for 5-6 hours straight for only one interview. Tools for transcribing become to appear, but it was still a lot to do in terms of formatting. That is why almost always there was an "outsourcing market" inside the university - so anyone can earn money by this awful work.  

I thought Whisper by OpenAI was the best in terms of punctuation in Russian, but still, it is very hard to divide the speech of interviewer and repontdent. So I created this tool and make some money on it until publishing it for free in Colab.
