**ML1 - “Sexual desirability”**
People look for different things in partners, different personality traits can attract a person. However, it is worth taking into account what kind of relationship a person wants: long-term for building a family, living together, or short-term to satisfy sexual needs.Since the goals during the search for a partner are different, the focus of attention will be aimed at different qualities of a person.

The authors (Pamela C. Regan, Lauren Levin,Susan Sprecher,F. Scott Christopher & Rodney Gate) of the research “What Characteristics Do Men and Women Desire In Their Short-Term Sexual and Long-Term Romantic Partners?” (2008) has such a results on this topic: “both men and women focused upon sexual desirability (e.g., attractiveness, health, sex drive, athleticism) when evaluating a short-term sexual partner, and placed more importance on similarity and on socially appealing personality characteristics (e.g., intelligence, honesty, warmth) when considering a long-term romantic relationship.”

So, as I think, the factor can be interpreted as Sexual desirability (or Sexuality) factor

**ML2 - “Highbrowness”**
ML2 describes the activities, which are strictly related to highbrow culture. In comparison with music or movies which can be highbrow, lowbrow or middlebrow, activities that this factor have a relation with is usually treated as highbrow. So, If a person says that he is fond of theater, art, or likes to go to museums, this signals that the person is fond of highbrow culture.

The terms of high- and lowbrow culture is one of the key concepts in the of Bourdie’s “The Difference: Social Criticism of the Judgment of Taste” (1979). “Taste has as much to do with expressed distaste for the aesthetic preferences attributed to other social groups as with positive adherence to the preferences of one’s own social group” and that is why such a distinction between cultural activites exists.

I would like to name the factor “Highbrowness”.
