# Analysis of Top Selling Beats on Beatstars

***View in my [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/tim_toothed/1121360) page***

### tldr

1. Web-scraped the stats from the beatmaker market website with Selenium -> 2 dataset with beats (372 obs.) and producers (202 obs.)
2. Made the visualizations and describe the dataset
3. Analyzed correlations and found factors of success by regression analysis (not so much interesting tbh...)

### Background
Study project on Web-Scraping which went probably too far since I was making beats myself and therefore had a direct interest in such analysis.
