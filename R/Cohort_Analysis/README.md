# Cohort Analysis for Charity

## tldr
Charity non-profit organisation provided access to data on remittances to their accounts - donations - and gave several objectives, including they wanted to see a detailed cohort analysis relating to donations from beneficiaries. This paper describes and compares the dynamics of organisationâ€™s beneficiaries. Donors of 2016-2022 are divided by the month of the first payment, the dynamics of each cohort is tracked during the period of one year, then the results of different years are compared. In this way it was possible to find both regularities in certain months and multi-year dynamics of funds receipt.
